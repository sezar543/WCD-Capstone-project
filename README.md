# Capstone Project: Scalable Image Classification Deployment

## Objective
Built and deployed an image classification model to predict tags for images of the Amazon rainforest.

## Technologies Used
- **MLFlow:** Model tracking and versioning.
- **Streamlit:** Frontend for monitoring and visualization.
- **AWS Lambda:** Serverless deployment.
- **Docker:** Containerization.
- **API Gateway:** Routing and serving requests.

## Deployment Methods
- FastAPI in a Docker container.
- MLFlow and FastAPI in a Docker container.
- AWS API Gateway + Lambda.

## Monitoring and Visualization on Streamlit
- **Daily Inference Counts:** Bar graphs for inference counts by deployment method.
- **Tag Prediction Analysis:** Distribution analysis of tags predicted by the model.

## MLOps
Implemented CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions for streamlined deployment and monitoring.
